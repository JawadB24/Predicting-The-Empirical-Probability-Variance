# Predicting The Empirical Probability Variance
Simulates the drawing of poker hands and creates a load of data in the form of the simulation_data.csv file used in prediction (ensure simulation_data.csv is used in the prediction).
Predicts the empirical probability variance of any poker hand with an average 93.6% accuracy.
Visualizations using Matplotlib are created to observe the comparison between residuals, predicted values, and actual values.
